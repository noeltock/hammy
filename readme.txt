Hammy speeds up your website by generating and serving resized images for your content area depending on content width.

== Description ==

= Introduction =

Hammy takes your regular content images (only within posts and pages, not custom post types) and regenerates a number of smaller sized images. When a person visits your website, it then automatically provides them with the most appropriate image (or the smallest one possible). This makes for a better experience, especially on mobile. This uses the new WP 3.5 image code.

= Will it work on my Theme? =

**Yes!** (the only exception being themes with no standard posts or pages)

= How does it work? =

When activated, the `<img>` tag is replaced by the `<figure>` tag, and the alternate image sizes are provided in a way that only jQuery can access/load. If jQuery isn't available, it falls back to the regular image you had there in the first place.

It also takes on any classes or alternate titles from the original image. It does not make any changes to your database (i.e. content or images that you already have remain untouched).

= What else do I need to know? =

* Supports Retina
* Uses WordPress 3.5 Image Code (no external dependency)
* You need to be willing to **spend a few minutes configuring and playing with the breakpoints and choosing the correct parent container** to get it right.
* Hammy filters the output every single time, but only needs to generate a resized image once.

Hammy already starts working upon activation, so any configuration is optional:

1. Upload the folder `hammy` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. (Optional) Go to Settings -> Hammy and review the options. Add the id/class of the container that holds your posts (i.e. #content). Then add breakpoints that are relevant to that container ( **see the FAQ for an example** ).
1. (Optional) Edit your theme's CSS to add `figure.hammy-responsive`, in a way that it is identical to any `img` styling used for your content area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the post/page container setting work? =

The width of your browser is quite different than that of the post/page container (i.e. #content). By being able to measure the width of the content container instead of the browser window, you'll ensure far better accuracy at all breakpoints.

= Breakpoints example? =

If your website is 960px wide, but the content (#content) is only 600px, then `600` is your largest breakpoint. If the next smaller size is iPhone landscape (where the sidebar is also positioned underneath the content) and you have a 10px margin on either side, that breakpoint is `460` (480 minus 20), and so forth.

At the end, your breakpoints may look like `300,460,600`

= It doesn't work with this gallery plugin or something else, what to do? =

You have the ability to ignore certain classes (i.e. ".gallery-thumb"), but please let me know of any edge-cases on the [Hammy forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hammy)

= How is Hammy constructed? =

Hammy is possible through two awesome open source projects:

* [jQuery Picture](http://jquerypicture.com/) by [Abban Dunne](http://abandon.ie/) (this script has been sligthly altered in order to be able to target a particular container).
* [WPThumb](http://hmn.md/introducing-wp-thumb/) by [Human Made Limited](http://hmn.md)

They're both worth checking out and getting a better understanding of (or using in your mega-awesome WordPress client projects).

= What's with the squirrel? =

Hammy, from the movie "Over the Hedge", he's quite fast, like these images. Be sure to check out the movie for full appreciation.
